[working with z80pack]

- z80-asm will generate a .z80 file that can be directly loaded to z80-mon

- z80-file(5)
Data come after address. Data are raw compiled program. Length of data can be
simply calculated to 'length of file - 10' bytes.

we have to disregard and skip the first 10 bytes

- bin2hex
there is one in z80pack/s/z80pack/cpmsim/srctools
$ cd z80pack/s/z80pack/cpmsim/srctools
$ gmake
$ gmake install

a bin2hex binary is copied to ${HOME}/bin

bin2hex -i10 float.z80 float.ihex


there is also py3-intelhex package

dd if=float.z80 of=float.data bs=1 skip=10

bin2hex.py float.data float.ihex

- the .ihex file can then be loaded to z80pack/z80sim
